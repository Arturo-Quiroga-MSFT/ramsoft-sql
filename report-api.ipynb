There is no evidence of significant consolidation or ground-glass opacity to suggest pneumonia or other acute inflammatory processes. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.Mediastinum and Lymph Nodes:Enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are noted, with the largest lymph node measuring 1.8 cm in the subcarinal region. Additional enlarged lymph nodes are present in the right paratracheal, aortopulmonary, and bilateral hilar regions, with sizes ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 cm in short-axis diameter.Heart and Great Vessels:The heart is normal in size with no evidence of pericardial effusion. The thoracic aorta is of normal caliber with no evidence of aneurysm or dissection. The pulmonary arteries are patent, with no signs of pulmonary embolism.Bones:There is evidence of diffuse osteopenia. Multiple lytic lesions are seen in the thoracic spine, ribs, and sternum, suggestive of metastatic disease. The largest lesion is located in the T8 vertebral body, measuring 1.5 cm, with mild cortical thinning.Soft Tissues:No significant soft tissue abnormalities or masses are identified.

Multiple irregularly shaped lesions are noted throughout the hepatic parenchyma with varying signal characteristics on T1- and T2-weighted images. The largest lesion is located in segment VIII, measuring 4.5 cm in greatest dimension, and demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement on post-contrast imaging, with early arterial phase hyperenhancement and subsequent washout in the portal venous phase, suggestive of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Additional lesions exhibiting similar imaging characteristics are found in segments II, IV, and VI, measuring 3.8 cm, 2.5 cm, and 2.0 cm in diameter, respectively.Bile Ducts:The intrahepatic bile ducts are mildly dilated, especially in the left lobe, with the common bile duct measuring 9 mm in diameter, indicative of mild biliary obstruction. There is no evidence of choledocholithiasis or intrahepatic duct stones.Gallbladder:The gallbladder is contracted and contains multiple calculi with posterior acoustic shadowing. The gallbladder wall is thickened, measuring up to 5 mm, consistent with chronic cholecystitis. There is no pericholecystic fluid or evidence of acute inflammation.Pancreas:The pancreas is unremarkable in size and signal intensity. No focal pancreatic lesions or ductal dilatation is identified. The pancreatic duct measures 2 mm, which is within normal limits.Spleen:The spleen is slightly enlarged, measuring 14 cm in craniocaudal dimension. It exhibits homogeneous signal intensity, and no focal splenic lesions are identified.Adrenal Glands:The bilateral adrenal glands appear normal in size and morphology, with no evidence of masses or hyperplasia.Vasculature:The portal vein is patent, with no evidence of thrombosis. The hepatic veins are also patent, with no signs of Budd-Chiari syndrome. The inferior vena cava is within normal limits.Impression:Significant hepatomegaly with nodular contour consistent with cirrhosis.Multiple hepatic lesions with imaging characteristics suggestive of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the largest measuring 4.5 cm in segment VIII.Mild biliary obstruction with intrahepatic ductal dilation and a common bile duct measuring 9 mm.Chronic cholecystitis with gallstones.Mild splenomegaly.Recommendations include correlation with clinical and laboratory findings, as well as potential biopsy of liver lesions for histopathologic confirmation.

The patient would benefit from further evaluation by the oncology team to determine the best course of systemic therapy or palliative care.', ' Patient:John Doe, 58-year-old maleModality:CT Chest with ContrastClinical History:History of hepatitis C with known hepatocellular carcinoma, presenting with weight loss and shortness of breath.Findings:Lungs:Multiple scattered pulmonary nodules are identified in both lungs, the largest measuring 2.1 cm in the right upper lobe, with some demonstrating cavitation. There is no evidence of significant consolidation or ground-glass opacity to suggest pneumonia or other acute inflammatory processes. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.Mediastinum and Lymph Nodes:Enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are noted, with the largest lymph node measuring 1.8 cm in the subcarinal region. Additional enlarged lymph nodes are present in the right paratracheal, aortopulmonary, and bilateral hilar regions, with sizes ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 cm in short-axis diameter.Heart and Great Vessels:The heart is normal in size with no evidence of pericardial effusion. The thoracic aorta is of normal caliber with no evidence of aneurysm or dissection. The pulmonary arteries are patent, with no signs of pulmonary embolism.Bones:There is evidence of diffuse osteopenia. Multiple lytic lesions are seen in the thoracic spine, ribs, and sternum, suggestive of metastatic disease. The largest lesion is located in the T8 vertebral body, measuring 1.5 cm, with mild cortical thinning.Soft Tissues:No significant soft tissue abnormalities or masses are identified. The visualized portion of the upper abdomen reveals an enlarged liver with nodular contour and multiple hypodense lesions, consistent with the known history of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.Impression:Multiple pulmonary nodules, some cavitating, concerning for metastatic disease.Enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, also concerning for metastatic involvement.Multiple lytic bone lesions in the thoracic spine, ribs, and sternum, consistent with metastatic disease.No evidence of acute pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.No evidence of pulmonary embolism.Overall, the findings are consistent with advanced metastatic disease from a primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Further evaluation by oncology is recommended for potential systemic therapy or palliative care.', ' Patient:John Doe, 58-year-old maleModality:MRI Abdomen with ContrastClinical History:History of hepatitis C, presenting with weight loss, jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes.Findings:Liver:The liver is significantly enlarged, measuring approximately 22 cm in craniocaudal dimension, with a nodular contour suggestive of cirrhosis. Multiple irregularly shaped lesions are noted throughout the hepatic parenchyma with varying signal characteristics on T1- and T2-weighted images. The largest lesion is located in segment VIII, measuring 4.5 cm in greatest dimension, and demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement on post-contrast imaging, with early arterial phase hyperenhancement and subsequent washout in the portal venous phase, suggestive of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Additional lesions exhibiting similar imaging characteristics are found in segments II, IV, and VI, measuring 3.8 cm, 2.5 cm, and 2.0 cm in diameter, respectively.Bile Ducts:The intrahepatic bile ducts are mildly dilated, especially in the left lobe, with the common bile duct measuring 9 mm in diameter, indicative of mild biliary obstruction. There is no evidence of choledocholithiasis or intrahepatic duct stones.Gallbladder:The gallbladder is contracted and contains multiple calculi with posterior acoustic shadowing. The gallbladder wall is thickened, measuring up to 5 mm, consistent with chronic cholecystitis. There is no pericholecystic fluid or evidence of acute inflammation.Pancreas:The pancreas is unremarkable in size and signal intensity. No focal pancreatic lesions or ductal dilatation is identified. The pancreatic duct measures 2 mm, which is within normal limits.Spleen:The spleen is slightly enlarged, measuring 14 cm in craniocaudal dimension. It exhibits homogeneous signal intensity, and no focal splenic lesions are identified.Adrenal Glands:The bilateral adrenal glands appear normal in size and morphology, with no evidence of masses or hyperplasia.Vasculature:The portal vein is patent, with no evidence of thrombosis. The hepatic veins are also patent, with no signs of Budd-Chiari syndrome. The inferior vena cava is within normal limits.Impression:Significant hepatomegaly with nodular contour consistent with cirrhosis.Multiple hepatic lesions with imaging characteristics suggestive of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the largest measuring 4.5 cm in segment VIII.Mild biliary obstruction with intrahepatic ductal dilation and a common bile duct measuring 9 mm.Chronic cholecystitis with gallstones.Mild splenomegaly.Recommendations include correlation with clinical and laboratory findings, as well as potential biopsy of liver lesions for histopathologic confirmation. Further assessment by a multidisciplinary team is recommended for appropriate management planning, including potential liver transplantation evaluation.
